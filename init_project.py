## Project Overview
This is the {project_name} project. Please follow these guidelines when assisting with development:

## Project Structure
- `pm/` - Project management files and documentation
- `pm/phase1/` - Current phase tasks and planning
- `pm/phase1/TASKS.md` - Task tracking and project workflow

## Development Guidelines
1. Always check the current phase tasks in `pm/phase1/TASKS.md` before starting work
2. Update task status as you complete work
3. Follow the project's coding standards and conventions
4. Document significant changes and decisions
5. Test thoroughly before marking tasks as complete

## Task Management Workflow
- **TODO**: Task is defined but not started
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- **REVIEW**: Ready for code review
- **TESTING**: In testing phase
- **DONE**: Completed and verified
- **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies

## Communication
- Update task descriptions with progress notes
- Mark blockers clearly with reasons
- Document any architectural decisions in the appropriate phase folder

## Code Quality
- Write clean, readable code
- Include appropriate comments and documentation
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Ensure proper error handling

## Overview
Brief description of the {project_name} project.

## Project Management
This project uses a phase-based task management approach:
- Tasks are organized in the `pm/` directory
- Current phase tasks are tracked in `pm/phase1/TASKS.md`
- See `.copilot-instructions.md` for development guidelines

## Getting Started
1. Review the current phase tasks in `pm/phase1/TASKS.md`
2. Check the copilot instructions in `.copilot-instructions.md`
3. Set up your development environment
4. Start working on assigned tasks

## Project Structure

```

## Contributing
1. Check current tasks and pick an unassigned TODO item
2. Update task status to IN_PROGRESS
3. Work on the task following project guidelines
4. Update task status as you progress
5. Mark as DONE when complete
